->  got rid of multiple atoms from the scattering table due
    to non-standardized scale; need to check which ones I got rid of
    (iirc 3-4 total)

-> 	due to rounding messing things up, 
	all E_ev factors are rounded to nearest thousandth instead of ten-thousandth

-> saxs beamline @ CLS operates in 5-24 keV; choose whichever has best coverage in data within that range
-> Cromer Coefficients only valid from 0 -> 2 A⁻¹ (ATOMIC SCATRERING FACTORS AT HIGH ANGLES )

-> switched to perlecan from Alphafold prediction

-> classic algo time complexity is O(mn²) where m = number of "q" values, and n is the total number of atoms

2025-11-20
-> testing w/ wide range of proteins
-> anon. factors are only for ground state and very spotty
in coverage, so limited to ground state only on already
limited amount of metals
